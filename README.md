This app is no longer available as Watson Personality Insights has been discontinued.

This is an Android application written by Upendra Rajan to use IBM Watson Personality Insights to analyze public Twitter profiles.

It helps you get deeper personality insights on several dimensions, including personality traits, values, needs and consumer preferences.

If the user posts in another language, say Spanish, you can specify the input language as Spanish and then analyze their profile. IBM Watson AI currently supports analysis in English, Spanish, Arabic, Japanese and Korean.
